# Search Algorithms

# A* Algorithm (A Star Algorithm)

 This is a smart algorithm technique that looks for a better path to move from one vertices to another in a graph data structure. It determines this better path using a heuristic function which gives priority to nodes that are supposed to be better than others. Mostly used in path finding and game applications.

# Breadth First Search (Level Order Traversal)

This is a tree traversal algorithm that goes all the levels of the tree one by one. It examines all the nodes on all levels that are after the root before moving to the next level.

# Depth First Search.

This search algorithm goes through every left node before moving to the right

> Simply Go Deep

# Hashing Algorithm

A hash algorithm is a function that converts a data string into a numeric string output of fixed length.

Examples of Hashing Functions
- Mainly for security as in developing Public Keys for application
- SHA1
- MD5
- SHA256, SHA512

- Easier to index items in a database and also easier to retrieve them
- TImestamping
- Security


# Heap Sort.

Sorting algorithm where the maximum element in a heap is placed at the very end and the data is sorted continuously.

# Insertion Sort.

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

# Merge Sort.

Divides input array into two arrays and calls itself for the two halves before merging the two arrays.

> Divide and conquer.

# Quick Sort.

 Picks a pivot and builds a sorted array around it. It can be the last, the first, the median or even random
